I first became interested in software when I went do to a very early internship
in a research lab, when I wanted to become a nuclear physician. It should not be
a surprise that from then, software has only been a mean to an end, a tool to
accomplish something.

This is why I became interested in project management then agility, best
practices then software craftsmanship. After some experiences, I now get more
and more pragmatic and start to look into why things are as they are, into what
is the reason why things evolve, either at a team level or at a company level.

I currently act half as an agile consultant, half as a software developer, both
in D-EDGE
